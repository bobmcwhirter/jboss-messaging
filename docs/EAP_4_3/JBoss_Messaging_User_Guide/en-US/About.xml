   <para>JBoss Messaging is the new enterprise messaging system from JBoss. It
   is a complete rewrite of JBossMQ, the legacy JBoss JMS provider.</para>
   <para>JBoss Messaging is the default JMS provider in JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 4.3, for JBoss ESB and JBoss Service Integration
   Platform. It will also be the default JMS provider in JBoss Application
   Server 5. It is an integral part of Red Hat's strategy for
   messaging.</para>
   <para>Compared with JBossMQ, JBoss Messaging offers improved performance in
   both single node and clustered environments. It also features a much better modular architecture that
