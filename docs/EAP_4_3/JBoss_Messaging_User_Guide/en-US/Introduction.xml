		JBoss Messaging provides an open source and standards-based messaging platform and is an integral part of Red Hat's strategy for enterprise messaging. It is a complete rewrite of JBossMQ, the legacy JBoss JMS provider, and offers improved performance in both single node and clustered environments. It also features a much better modular architecture that allows easy adding of new features in the future.

		JBoss Messaging is committed to AMQP ( <ulink url="http://www.amqp.org">AMQP</ulink>)- the new messaging standard from Red Hat and others. Later versions of JBoss Messaging will support AMQP, and JBoss Messaging will be focussed on becoming the premier AMQP Java broker.
