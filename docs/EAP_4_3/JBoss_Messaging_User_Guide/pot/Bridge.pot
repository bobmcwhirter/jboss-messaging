"This QoS mode ensures messages will reach the destination from the source "
"once and only once. (Sometimes this mode is known as \"exactly once\"). If "
"both the source and the destination are on the same JBoss Messaging server "
"instance then this can be achieved by sending and acknowledging the messages "
"in the same local transaction. If the source and destination are on "
"different servers this is achieved by enlisting the sending and consuming "
"sessions in a JTA transaction. The JTA transaction is controlled by JBoss "
"Transactions JTA implementation which is a fully recovering transaction "
"manager, thus providing a very high degree of durability. If JTA is required "
"then both supplied connection factories need to be XAConnectionFactory "
"implementations. This mode is only available for persistent messages. This "
"is likely to be the slowest mode since it requires logging on both the "
"transaction manager and resource side for recovery. If you require this "
"level of QoS, please be sure to enable XA recovery with JBoss Transactions."

"For a specific application it may possible to provide once and only once "
"semantics without using the QOS_ONCE_AND_ONLY_ONCE QoS level. This can be "
"done by using the QOS_DUPLICATES_OK mode and then checking for duplicates at "
"the destination and discarding them. This may be possible to implement on "
"the application level by maintaining a cache of received message ids on disk "
"and comparing received messages to them. The cache would only be valid for a "
"certain period of time so this approach is not as watertight as using "
"QOS_ONCE_AND_ONLY_ONCE but may be a good choice depending on your specific "
"application."
