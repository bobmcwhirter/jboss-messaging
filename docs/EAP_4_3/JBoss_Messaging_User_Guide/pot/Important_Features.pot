"It will allow you to smoothly distribute your application load across your "
"cluster, intelligently balancing and utilizing each node's CPU cycles. It "
"comes with no single point of failure and no single point of bottleneck, "
"sophisticated and fully configurable message expiration handling and XA "
"transaction recovery. Thus providing a highly scalable and performant "
"clustering implementation. It includes a JMS front-end to deliver messaging "
"in a standards-based format as well as being designed to be able to support "
"other messaging protocols in the future."
