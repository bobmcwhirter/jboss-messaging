/**
 * This example deploys a simple Message Driven Bean that processes messages sent to a test queue.
 * The MDB container is configured to use CMT.
 *
 * We send a special tagged message (we do this by adding a custom property to the message) to the
 * MDB. The MDB is programmed to "fail" when handling such a message, by throwing a
 * RuntimeException, but not before "clearing" the failure-inducing tag.
 *
 * The expected behavior for the JMS provider is to redeliver the message, this time without the
 * "failure tag". The MDB is supposed to process it and put it on response queue, from were it will
 * be read by the client.
 *
 * The example is considered successful if the client receives the "processed" message.
 *
 * Since this example is also used by the smoke test, it is essential that the VM exits with exit
 * code 0 in case of successful execution and a non-zero value on failure.
