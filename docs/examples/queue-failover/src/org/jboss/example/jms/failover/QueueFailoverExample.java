/**
 * The example creates a connection to a clustered messaging instance and sends a message to a
 * clustered queue. The example then kills the cluster node the connection was created to and then
 * shows how the client code can receive the message with using the *same* connection (that, in
 * the mean time, have transparently failed over to another cluster node).
 *
 * Since this example is also used as a smoke test, it is essential that the VM exits with exit
 * code 0 in case of successful execution and a non-zero value on failure.
