   <title>Introducing JBoss Messaging</title>

   <para>JBoss Messaging is a high performance JMS provider in the JBoss Enterprise Middleware Stack (JEMS). It is a complete rewrite of JBossMQ, which is the current default JMS provider in JBoss AS 4.x. JBoss Messaging will be the default JMS provider in JBoss AS 5.x and later, and it is the backbone of the JBoss ESB infrastructure.</para>
   
   <para>Compared with JBossMQ, JBoss Messaging offers vastly improved performance in both single node and clustered environments. Please see <ulink url="http://wiki.jboss.org/wiki/Wiki.jsp?page=JBossMessagingPerformanceResultsPre1_0">this wiki page</ulink> for performance benchamrks and <xref linkend="performance"/> on how to generate your own performance benchmarks. It also features a much better internal architecture that would allow us to add more features in the future.</para>
   
   <para>While JBoss Messaging only becomes the default JMS provider from JBoss AS 5.x, production users on JBoss AS 4.x can still take advantage of the performance improvements by easily replacing the JBossMQ module with JBoss Messaging.</para>
   
   <para>In this guide, we discuss how to install and use JBoss Messaging in JBoss 4.x production servers. We cover JBoss Messaging-specific configuration options, as well as how to run the build-in sanity / performance tests.</para>
