    <title>The Client Classpath</title>
    <para>In this chapter we explain what jars you need on the Java classpath of a JBoss Messaging
        client application. This depends on whether you're using just core, or JMS amongst other
        things. We explain what jars are needed in each case.</para>
    <para>All the jars mentioned here can be found in the <literal>lib</literal> directory of the
        JBoss Messaging distribution. Be sure you only use the jars from the correct version of the
        release, you <emphasis>must not</emphasis> mix and match versions of jars from different
        JBoss Messaging versions.</para>
    <section>
        <title>Pure Core Client</title>
        <para>If you're using just a pure JBoss Messaging core client (i.e. no JMS) then you need
                <literal>jbm-core-client.jar</literal> on your client classpath. If you're using a
            Netty transport then you will also netty <literal>netty.jar</literal> and <literal
                >jbm-transports.jar</literal>.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
        <title>JMS Client</title>
        <para>If you're using JMS on the client side, then you will need <literal
                >jbm-core-client.jar</literal>, <literal>jbm-jms-client.jar</literal> and <literal
                >jboss-javaee.jar</literal>. Note that <literal>jboss-javaee.jar</literal> just
            contains Java EE API interface classes needed for the <literal>javax.jms.*</literal>
            classes, so if you already have a jar with these interface classes on your classpath you
            won't need <literal>jboss-javaee.jar</literal>.  If you're using a Netty transport then
            you will also netty <literal>netty.jar</literal> and <literal
                >jbm-transports.jar</literal>.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
        <title>JNDI</title>
        <para>If you're looking up JNDI objects from the JNDI server co-located with the JBoss
            Messaging standalone server you'll also need the jar <literal>jnp-client.jar</literal>
            and WHAT OTHER JARS for JNDI? TODO TODO</para>
