    <para>In this chapter we discuss the concepts behind JBoss Messaging clusters, and how to
        configure them.</para>
    <section>
        <title>Clusters Overview</title>
        <para>JBoss Messaging clusters allow groups of JBoss Messaging servers to be grouped
            together in order to share message processing load. Each active node in the cluster is
            an active JBoss Messaging server which manages its own messages and handles its own
            connections. A server must be configured to be clustered, you will need to set the
                <literal>clustered</literal> element in the <literal>jbm-configuration.xml</literal>
            configuration file to <literal>true</literal>, this is <literal>false</literal> by
            default.</para>
        <para>The cluster is formed by each node declaring <emphasis>cluster connections</emphasis>
            to other nodes in the core configuration file <literal>jbm-configuration.xml</literal>.
            When a node forms a cluster connection to another node, internally it creates a <xref
                linkend="core-bridges">core bridge</xref> connection between it and the other node,
            this is done transparently behind the scenes - you don't have to declare an explicit
            bridge for each node. These cluster connections allow messages to flow between the nodes
            of the cluster to balance load.</para>
        <para>Nodes can be connected together to form a cluster in many different topologies, we
            will discuss a couple of the more common topologies later in this chapter.</para>
        <para>We'll also discuss client side load balancing, where we can balance client connections
            across the nodes of the cluster, and we'll consider message redistribution where JBoss
            Messaging will redistribute messages between nodes to avoid starvation.</para>
        <para>Another important part of clustering is <emphasis>server discovery</emphasis> where
            servers can broadcast their connection details so clients or other servers can connect
            to them with the minimum of configuration.</para>

        <title>Server discovery</title>
        <para>Server discovery is a mechanism by which servers can broadcast their connection
            settings across the network. This is useful for two purposes:</para>
        <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
                <para>Discovery by messaging clients. A messaging client wants to be able to connect
                    to the servers of the cluster without having specific knowledge of which servers
                    in the cluster are up at any one time. Messaging clients
                        <emphasis>can</emphasis> be initialised with an explicit list of the servers
                    in a cluster, but this is not flexible or maintainable as servers are added or
                    removed from the cluster.</para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
                <para>Discovery by other servers. Servers in a cluster want to be able to create
                    cluster connections to each other without having prior knowledge of all the
                    other servers in the cluster. </para>
            </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>
        <para>Server discovery uses <ulink url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_Datagram_Protocol"
                >UDP</ulink> multicast to broadcast server connection settings. If UDP is disabled
            on your network you won't be able to use this, and will have to specify servers
            explicitly when setting up a cluster or using a messaging client.</para>
        <section id="clusters.broadcast-groups">
            <title>Broadcast Groups</title>
            <para>A broadcast group is the means by which a server broadcasts connectors over the
                network. A connector defines a way in which a client (or other server) can make
                connections to the server. For more information on what a connector is please see
                    <xref linkend="configuring-transports">here</xref>.</para>
            <para>The broadcast group takes a set of connector pairs, each connector pair contains
                connection settings for a live and (optional) backup server and broadcasts them on
                the network. It also defines the UDP address and port settings. </para>
            <para>Broadcast groups are defined in the server configuration file <literal
                    >jbm-configuration.xml</literal>. There can be many broadcast groups per JBoss
                Messaging server. All broadcast groups must be defined in a <literal
                    >broadcast-groups</literal> element.</para>
            <para>Let's take a look at an example broadcast group from <literal
                    >jbm-configuration.xml</literal>:</para>
            <programlisting>&lt;broadcast-groups>
   &lt;broadcast-group name="my-broadcast-group">
      &lt;local-bind-port>54321&lt;/local-bind-port>
      &lt;group-address>231.7.7.7&lt;/group-address>
      &lt;group-port>9876&lt;/group-port>
      &lt;broadcast-period>1000&lt;/broadcast-period>
      &lt;connector-ref connector-name="netty-connector" 
        backup-connector-name="backup-connector"/>
   &lt;/broadcast-group>
&lt;/broadcast-groups></programlisting>
            <para>Some of the broadcast group parameters are optional and you'll normally use the
                defaults, but we specify them all in the above example for clarity. Let's discuss
                each one in turn:</para>
            <itemizedlist>
                <listitem>
                    <para><literal>name</literal> attribute. Each broadcast group in the server must
                        have a unique name. </para>
                </listitem>
                <listitem>
                    <para><literal>local-bind-address</literal>. TODO. This is the local bind
                        address that the datagram socket is bound to. If you have multiple network
                        interfaces on your server, you would specify which one you wish to use for
                        broadcasts by setting this property. If this property is not specified then
                        TODO TODO</para>
                </listitem>
                <listitem>
                    <para><literal>local-bind-port</literal>. If you want to specify a local port to
                        which the datagram socket is bound you can specify it here. Normally you
                        would just use the default value of <literal>-1</literal> which signifies
                        that an anonymous port should be used.</para>
                </listitem>
                <listitem>
                    <para><literal>group-address</literal>. This is the multicast address to which
                        the data will be broadcast. It is a class D IP address in the range <literal
                            >224.0.0.0</literal> to <literal>239.255.255.255</literal>, inclusive.
                        The address <literal>224.0.0.0</literal> is reserved and is not available
                        for use. This parameter is mandatory.</para>
                </listitem>
                <listitem>
                    <para><literal>group-port</literal>. This is the UDP port number used for
                        broadcasting. This parameter is mandatory.</para>

                <listitem>
                    <para><literal>broadcast-period</literal>. This is the period in milliseconds
                        between consecutive broadcasts. This parameter is optional, the default
                        value is <literal>1000</literal> milliseconds.</para>

                    <para><literal>connector-ref</literal>. This specifies the connector and
                        optional backup connector that will be broadcast. Please see <xref
                            linkend="configuring-transports">here</xref> for more information on
                        connectors. The connector to be broadcast is specified by the <literal
                            >connector-name</literal> attribute, and the backup connector to be
                        broadcast is specified by the <literal>backup-connector</literal> attribute.
                        The <literal>backup-connector</literal> attribute is optional.</para>

            <title>Discovery Groups</title>
            <para>While the broadcast group defines who connector information is broadcast from a
                server, a discovery group defines how connector information is received from a
                multicast address.</para>
            <para>A discovery group maintains a list of connector pairs - one for each broadcast by
                a different server. As it receives broadcasts on the multicast group address from a
                particular server it updates its entry in the list for that server.</para>
            <para>If it has not received a broadcast from a particular server for a length of time
                it will remove that server's entry from its list.</para>
            <para>Discovery groups are used in two places in JBoss Messaging:</para>

            <title>Defining Discovery Groups on the Server</title>
            <para>For cluster connections, discovery groups are defined in the server side
                configuration file <literal>jbm-configuration.xml</literal>. All discovery groups
                must be defined inside a <literal>discovery-groups</literal> element. There can be
                many discovery groups defined by JBoss Messaging server. Let's look at an
                example:</para>
            <programlisting>&lt;discovery-groups>
   &lt;discovery-group name="my-discovery-group">
      &lt;group-address>231.7.7.7&lt;/group-address>
      &lt;group-port>9876&lt;/group-port>
      &lt;refresh-timeout>10000&lt;/refresh-timeout>
   &lt;/discovery-group>
&lt;/discovery-groups></programlisting>
            <para>We'll consider each parameter of the discovery group:</para>
            <itemizedlist>
                <listitem>
                    <para><literal>name</literal> attribute. Each discovery group must have a unique
                        name per server.</para>
                </listitem>
                <listitem>
                    <para><literal>group-address</literal>. This is the multicast ip address of the
                        group to listen on. It should match the <literal>group-address</literal> in
                        the broadcast group that you wish to listen from. This parameter is
                        mandatory.</para>
                </listitem>
                <listitem>
                    <para><literal>group-port</literal>. This is the UDP port of the multicast
                        group. It should match the <literal>group-port</literal> in the broadcast
                        group that you wish to listen from. This parameter is mandatory.</para>
                </listitem>
                <listitem>
                    <para><literal>refresh-timeout</literal>. This is the period the discovery group
                        waits after receiving the last broadcast from a particular server before
                        removing that servers connector pair entry from its list. You would normally
                        set this to a value significantly higher than the <literal
                            >broadcast-period</literal> on the broadcast group otherwise servers
                        might intermittently disappear from the list even though they are still
                        broadcasting due to slight differences in timing. This parameter is
                        optional, the default value is <literal>10000</literal> milliseconds (10
                        seconds).</para>

        <section id="clusters-discovery.groups.clientside">
            <title>Discovery Groups on the Client Side</title>
            <para>Let's discuss how to configure a JBoss Messaging client to use discovery to
                discover a list of servers to which it can connect. The way to do this differs
                depending on whether you're using JMS or the core API.</para>
            <section>
                <title>Configuring client discovery using JMS</title>
                <para>If you're using JMS and you're also using the JMS Service on the server to
                    load your JMS connection factory instances into JNDI, then you can specify which
                    discovery group to use for your JMS connection factory in the server side xml
                    configuration <literal>jbm-jms.xml</literal>. Let's take a look at an
                    example:</para>
                <programlisting>&lt;connection-factory name="ConnectionFactory">
   &lt;discovery-group-ref discovery-group-name="my-discovery-group"/>
    &lt;entries>
       &lt;entry name="ConnectionFactory"/>
    &lt;/entries>
&lt;/connection-factory></programlisting>
                <para>The element <literal>discovery-group-ref</literal> specifies the name of a
                    discovery group defined in <literal>jbm-configuration.xml</literal>.</para>
                <para>When this connection factory is downloaded from JNDI by a client application
                    and JMS connections are created from it, those connections will be load-balanced
                    across the list of servers that the discovery group maintains by listening on
                    the multicast address specified in the discovery group configuration.</para>
                <para>If you're using JMS, but you're not using JNDI to lookup a connection factory
                    - you're instantiating the JMS connection factory directly then you can specify
                    the discovery group parameters directly when creating the JMS connection
                    factory. Here's an
                    example:<programlisting>final String groupAddress = "231.7.7.7";

final int groupPort = 9876;

ConnectionFactory jmsConnectionFactory = 
        new JBossConnectionFactory(groupAddress, groupPort);

Connection jmsConnection1 = jmsConnectionFactory.createConnection();

Connection jmsConnection2 = jmsConnectionFactory.createConnection();</programlisting></para>
                <para>The <literal>refresh-timeout</literal> can be set directly on the connection
                    factory by using the setter method <literal>setDiscoveryRefreshTimeout() if you
                        want to change the default value.</literal></para>
                <para>There is also a further parameter settable on the connection factory using the
                    setter method <literal>setInitialWaitTimeout()</literal>. If the connection
                    factory is used immediately after creation then it may not have had enough time
                    to received broadcasts from all the nodes in the cluster. On first usage, the
                    connection factory will make sure it waits this long since creation before
                    creating the first connection. The default value for this parameter is <literal
                        >2000</literal> milliseconds.</para>
            </section>
            <section>
                <title>Configuring client discovery using Core</title>
                <para>If you're using the core API to directly instantiate <literal
                        >ClientSessionFactory</literal> instances, then you can specify the
                    discovery group parameters directly when creating the session factory. Here's an
                    example:final String groupAddress = "231.7.7.7"; final int groupPort = 9876;
                    SessionFactory factory = new ClientSessionFactoryImpl(groupAddress, groupPort);
                    ClientSession session1 = factory.createClientSession(...); ClientSession
                    session2 = factory.createClientSession(...); </para>
                <para>The <literal>refresh-timeout</literal> can be set directly on the session
                    factory by using the setter method <literal>setDiscoveryRefreshTimeout() if you
                        want to change the default value.</literal></para>
                <para>There is also a further parameter settable on the session factory using the

        <title>Server-Side Message Load Balancing</title>
        <para>If cluster connections are defined between nodes of a cluster, then JBoss Messaging
            will load balance messages arriving from at a particular node from a client.</para>
        <para>Let's take a simple example of a cluster of four nodes A, B, C, and D arranged in a
                <xref linkend="symmetric-cluster">symmetric cluster</xref>. We have a queue called
                <literal>OrderQueue</literal> deployed on each node of the cluster.</para>
        <para>We have client Ca connected to node A, sending orders to the server. We have also have
            order processor clients Pa, Pb, Pc, and Pd connected to each of the nodes A, B, C, D. If
            no cluster connection was defined on node A, then as order messages arrive on node A
            they will all end up in the <literal>OrderQueue</literal> on node A, so will only get
            consumed by the order processor client attached to node A, Pa.</para>
        <para>If we define a cluster connection on node A, then as ordered messages arrive on node A
            instead of all of them going into the local <literal>OrderQueue</literal> instance, they
            are distributed in a round-robin fashion between all the nodes of the cluster. The
            messages are forwarded from the receiving node to other nodes of the cluster. This is
            all done on the server side, the client maintains a single connection to node A.</para>
        <para>For example, messages arriving on node A might be distributed in the following order
            between the nodes: B, D, C, A, B, D, C, A, B, D. The exact order depends on the order
            the nodes started up, but the algorithm used is round robin.</para>
        <para>JBoss Messaging cluster connections can be configured to always blindly load balance
            messages in a round robin fashion irrespective of whether there are any matching
            consumers on other nodes, but they can be a bit cleverer than that and also be
            configured to only distribute to other nodes if they have matching consumers. We'll look
            at both these cases in turn with some examples, but first we'll discuss configuring

            <title>Configuring Cluster Connections</title>
            <para>Cluster connections group servers into clusters so that messages can be load
                balanced between the nodes of the cluster. Let's take a look at a typical cluster
                connection. Cluster connections are always defined in <literal
                    >jbm-configuration.xml</literal> inside a <literal>cluster-connection</literal>
                element. There can be zero or more cluster connections defined per JBoss Messaging
                server.</para>
            <programlisting>
&lt;cluster-connections&gt;
    &lt;cluster-connection name="my-cluster"&gt;
        &lt;address&gt;jms&lt;/address&gt;

    &lt;/cluster-connection&gt;
&lt;/cluster-connections&gt;                
            </programlisting>
            <para>In the above cluster connection all parameters have been explicitly specified. In
                practice you might use the defaults for some.</para>

                <listitem>
                    <para><literal>address</literal>. Each cluster connection only applies to
                        messages sent to an address that starts with this value.</para>
                    <para>In this case, this cluster connection will load balance messages sent to
                        address that start with <literal>jms</literal>. This cluster connection,
                        will, in effect apply to all JMS queue and topic subscriptions since they
                        map to core queues that start with the substring "jms".</para>
                    <para>The address can be any value and you can have many cluster connections
                        with different values of <literal>address</literal>, simultaneously
                        balancing messages for those addresses, potentially to different clusters of
                        servers. By having multiple cluster connections on different addresses a
                        single JBoss Messaging Server can effectively take part in multiple clusters
                        simultaneously.</para>

                        this could result in the same messages being distributed between more than
                        one cluster connection, possibly resulting in duplicate deliveries. </para>

                        cluster connections cause bridges to be created between the nodes of the
                        cluster. If the cluster connection is created and the target node has not
                        been started, or say, is being rebooted, then the cluster connections from
                        other nodes will retry connecting to the target until it comes back up, in

                        use bridges to link the nodes, and bridges can be configured to add a
                        duplicate id property in each message that is forwarded. If the target node
                        of the bridge crashes and then recovers, messages might be resent from the
                        source node. By enabling duplicate detection any duplicate messages will be

        <para>With JBoss Messaging client-side connection load balancing, subsequent client
            connections created using a single factory can be made to different nodes of the
            cluster. This allows connections to spread smoothly across the nodes of a cluster and
            not be "clumped" on any particular node.</para>
        <para>The load balancing policy to be used by the client factory is configurable. JBoss
            Messaging provides two out-of-the-box load balancing policies and you can also implement
            your own and use that.</para>

        <para>If you're using JMS but you're instantiating your connection factory directly on the

        <para>In this case, the list of servers in the cluster can be specified explicitly on each

            <para>The <literal>cluster-connection</literal> element can contain zero or more
                    <literal>connector-ref</literal> elements, each one of which specifies a

                    <literal>backup-connector-name</literal> is optional, and if specified it also

        <title>Message Redistribution</title>
        <para>Another important part of clustering is message redistribution. Earlier we learned how
            server side message load balancing round robins messages across the cluster. If <literal
                >forward-when-no-consumers</literal> is false, then messages won't be forwarded to
            nodes which don't have matching consumers, this is great and ensures that messages don't
            arrive on a queue which has no consumers to consume them, however there is a situation
            it doesn't solve: What happens if the consumers on a queue close after the messages have
            been sent to the node? If there are no consumers on the queue the message won't get
            consumed and we have a <emphasis>starvation</emphasis> situation.</para>
        <para>This is where message redistribution comes in. With message redistribution JBoss
            Messaging can be configured to automatically <emphasis>redistribute</emphasis> messages
            from queues which have no consumers back to other nodes in the cluster which do have
            matching consumers.</para>
        <para>Message redistribution can be configured to kick in immediately after the last
            consumer on a queue is closed, or to wait a configurable delay after the last consumer
            on a queue is closed before redistributing. By default message redistribution is
            disabled.</para>
        <para>Message redistribution can be configured on a per address basis, by specifying the
            redistribution delay in the address settings, for more information on configuring
            address settings please see <xref linkend="queue-attributes">here</xref>.</para>
        <para>Here's an address settings snippet from <literal>jbm-configuration.xml</literal>
            showing how message redistribution is enabled for a set of queues:</para>
        <programlisting>&lt;address-settings>     
   &lt;address-setting match="jms.#">
      &lt;redistribution-delay>0&lt;/redistribution-delay>
   &lt;/address-setting>
 &lt;/address-settings></programlisting>
        <para>The above <literal>address-settings</literal> block would set a <literal
                >redistribution-delay</literal> of <literal>0</literal> for any queue which is bound
            to an address that starts with "jms.". All JMS queues and topic subscriptions are bound
            to addresses that start with "jms.", so the above would enable instant (no delay)
            redistribution for all JMS queues and topic subscriptions.</para>
        <para>The attribute <literal>match</literal> can be an exact match or it can be a string
            that conforms to the JBoss Messaging wildcard syntax. <xref linkend="wildcard-syntax"
            /></para>
        <para>The element <literal>redistribution-delay</literal> defines the delay in milliseconds
            after the last consumer is closed on a queue before redistributing messages from that
            queue to other nodes of the cluster which do have matching consumers. A delay of zero
            means the messages will be immediately redistributed. A value of <literal>-1</literal>
            signifies that messages will never be redistributed. The default value is <literal
                >-1</literal>.</para>
        <para>It often makes sense to introduce a delay before redistributing as it's a common case
            that a consumer closes but another one quickly is created on the same queue, in such a
            case you probably don't want to redistribute immediately since the new consumer will
            arrive shortly.</para>

        <title>Cluster topologies</title>
        <para>JBoss Messaging clusters can be connected together in many different topologies, let's
            consider the two most common ones here</para>
        <section id="symmetric-cluster">
            <title>Symmetric cluster</title>
            <para>A symmetric cluster is probably the most common cluster topology, and you'll be
                familiar with if you've had experience of JBoss Application Server
                clustering.</para>
            <para>With a symmetric cluster every node in the cluster is connected to every other
                node in the cluster. In other words every node in the cluster is no more than one
                hop away from every other node.</para>
            <para>To form a symmetric cluster every node in the cluster defines a cluster connection
                with the attribute <literal>max-hops</literal> set to <literal>1</literal>.
                Typically the cluster connection will use server discovery in order to know what
                other servers in the cluster it should connect to, although it is possible to
                explicitly define each target server too in the cluster connection if, for example,
                UDP is not available on your network.</para>
            <para>With a symmetric cluster each node knows about all the queues that exist on all
                the other nodes and what consumers they have. With this knowledge it can determine
                how to load balance and redistribute messages around the nodes.</para>
        </section>
        <section>
            <title>Chain cluster</title>
            <para>With a chain cluster, each node in the cluster is not connected to every node in
                the cluster directly, instead the nodes form a chain with a node on each end of the
                chain and all other nodes just connecting to the previous and next nodes in the
                chain.</para>
            <para>An example of this would be a three node chain consisting of nodes A, B and C.
                Node A is hosted in one network and has many producer clients connected to it
                sending order messages. Due to corporate policy, the order consumer clients need to
                be hosted in a different network, and that network is only accessible via a third
                network. In this setup node B acts as a mediator with no producers or consumers on
                it. Any messages arriving on node A will be forwarded to node B, which will in turn
                forward them to node C where they can get consumed. Node A does not need to directly
                connect to C, but all the nodes can still act as a part of the cluster.</para>
            <para>To set up a cluster in this way, node A would define a cluster connection that
                connects to node B, and node B would define a cluster connection that connects to
                node C. In this case we only want cluster connections in one direction since we're
                only moving messages from node A->B->C and never from C->B->A.</para>
            <para>For this topology we would set <literal>max-hops</literal> to <literal
                >2</literal>. With a value of <literal>2</literal> the knowledge of what queues and
                consumers that exist on node C would be propagated from node C to node B to node A.
                Node A would then know to distribute messages to node B when they arrive, even
                though node B has no consumers itself, it would know that a further hop away is node
                C which does have consumers.</para>
