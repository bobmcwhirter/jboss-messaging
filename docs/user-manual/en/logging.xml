    <para>JBM leverages the Java Logging framework, JUL, for all its logging meaning we have no
        dependencies on any logging framework. Users can provide their own logging handler to use or
        alternatively use one of the handlers provided by JBM. There are 2 of these a Log4j handler
        and a JBoss logging handler.</para>
    <para>The handlers are configured via the JUL logging.properties file. This default location for
        this file is under the <literal>lib</literal> directory found in the Java home directory
        however can be overriden. The standalone JBM server does this and the
            <literal>logging.properties</literal> file can be found under the config directory of
        the JBM installation. </para>
    <para>To use the Log4j handler edit the <literal>logging.properties</literal> file and change
        the <literal>handlers</literal> property to:</para>
    <programlisting>handlers=org.jboss.messaging.integration.logging.Log4jLoggerHandler</programlisting>
    <para>A log4j config file <literal>log4j.xml</literal> is provided for configuring Log4j. </para>
    <para>To use the JBoss handler edit the <literal>logging.properties</literal> file and change
        the <literal>handlers</literal> property to:</para>
    <programlisting>handlers=org.jboss.messaging.integration.logging.JBossLoggerHandler</programlisting>
    <para>If using the JBoss handler the property
            <literal>org.jboss.logging.Logger.pluginClass</literal> must be set. By default this is
        set to <literal>org.jboss.messaging.integration.logging.JBMLoggerPlugin</literal> in the
        standalone server. Only change this property if you want to use your own plugin
        class.</para>
    <note>
        <para>If running JBM within the JBoss Application Server logging will default to what ever
            the AS is using. Refer to the AS docs for more info on how to configure logging.</para>
