        <title>Stomp and StompConnect</title>
        <para>Stomp is a wire protocol that allows stomp clients from to communicate with Stomp
            Brokers. Using StompConnect it is possible to turn JBM into a Stomp Broker and use any
            of the available stomp clients. These include clients written in C, C++, c# and .net
            etc. For more information on Stomp and StompConnect go to <ulink
                url="http://stomp.codehaus.org/Home"/></para>
        <para>To run Stomp first start the JBoss Messaging server and make sure that it is using
            JNDI.</para>
        <para>Stomp requires the file <literal>jndi.properties</literal> to be available on the
            classpath. This should look something like:</para>
        <programlisting>java.naming.factory.initial=org.jnp.interfaces.NamingContextFactory
java.naming.provider.url=jnp://localhost:1099
java.naming.factory.url.pkgs=org.jboss.naming:org.jnp.interfaces</programlisting>
        <para>Make sure this file is in the classpath along with the StompConnect jar and the JBoss
            Messaging jars and simply run <literal>java
            org.codehaus.stomp.jms.Main</literal>.</para>
