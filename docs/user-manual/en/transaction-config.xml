    <title>Resource Manager Configuration</title>
    <para>JBoss Messaging has its own Resource Manager for handling the lifespan of XA transactions.
        When a transaction is started the resource manager is notified and keeps a record of the
        transaction and its current state. It is possible in some cases for a transaction to be
        started but the forgotten about. Maybe the client died and never came back. If this happens
        then the transaction will just sit there indefinitely.</para>
    <para>To cope with this JBoss Messaging can, if configured, scan for old transactions and
        rollback any it finds. The default for this is 60000 milliseconds (1 minute), i.e. any
        transactions older than 60 seconds are removed, however this can be changed by editing the
            <literal>transaction-timeout</literal> property in <literal
            >jbm-configuration.xml</literal>. The property <literal
            >transaction-timeout-scan-period</literal> configures how often, in milliseconds, to
        scan for old transactions.</para>
