   <para>
      By default, a JBoss AS 4.0.x instance ships with JBossMQ as default JMS provider.
      In order to use the JBoss AS instance with JBoss Messaging, you need to perform the installation
      procedure described below.
   </para>

   <para>
      <warning>
         A JBossMQ and a JBoss Messaging instance cannot coexist, at least not unless special
         precautions are taken. Do not simply attempt to copy the Messaging release artifact
         <filename>jboss-messaging-scoped.sar</filename> over to the JBoss instance
         <filename>deploy</filename> directory. Follow one of the alternate installation procedures
         outlined below instead.

     <title>Installation procedure</title>

      <para>
         Set up the <literal>JBOSS_HOME</literal> environment variable to point to
         the JBoss 4.x installation you
         want to use JBoss Messaging with. Run the installation script, available in the
         <filename>util</filename> directory of the release bundle.
         Note that you need Apache Ant 1.6.x or newer installed and accessible from
         your current directory.
      </para>

       <programlisting>
    cd util
    ant -f release-admin.xml

       <para>
          The installation script will create a <filename>$JBOSS_HOME/server/messaging</filename>
          configuration.
       </para>

       <note>
          If you want to create a JBoss Messaging configuration with a different name, modify
          the <literal>messaging.config.name</literal> system property declared
          at the beginning of the installation script accordingly.

     <note>
        The warning message <literal>DataSource connection transaction isolation should be READ_COMMITTED, but it is currently NONE</literal>
        is there to remind you that by default JBossAS ships with Hypersonic, an in-memory
        Java-based database engine, which is apropriate for demo purposes, but not for heavy load
        production environments. The
        <ulink url="http://wiki.jboss.org/wiki/Wiki.jsp?page=ConfigJBossMQDB">Critique of Hypersonic</ulink>
        wiki page outlines some of the well-known issues occuring when using this database.
     </note>

     <warning>
        Before using Messaging in production, you <emphasis>must</emphasis> configure
        the Messaging instance to use an enterprise-class database backend such as MySQL or Oracle,
        otherwise you risk losing your data.
        See <xref linkend="conf.changingds"/> for details about replacing Hypersonic.

     <title>Installation Validation</title>

     <para>
        The release bundle contains a series of examples that should run "out of the box" and
        could be used to validate a new installation. Such an example sends a persistent JMS message
        to a queue called <literal>queue/testQueue</literal>.
     </para>


    <para>
       To run the example and validate the installation,
       open an new command line window and set the <literal>JBOSS_HOME</literal>
       environment variable to point to the JBoss AS 4.x installation you've just installed
       Messaging on. Navigate to the folder where
       you extracted the release bundle and drill down to <filename>/examples/queue</filename>.
       Apache Ant must pe present in your path in order to be able to run the example.
    </para>

   <programlisting>

    setenv JBOSS_HOME=&lt;your_JBoss_installation&gt;
    cd .../examples/queue
