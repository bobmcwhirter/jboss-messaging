   <title>About JBoss Messaging 2.0</title>
   <para>JBoss Messaging 2.0 is the new generation of JBoss' flagship messaging project</para>
   <para>JBM 2.0's elegant new POJO-based design and re-factored core allows it to run in JBoss Micro-container as well as being embeddable in your own applications. It also contains a new optimised persistence model that removes the database as a point of contention in the architecture and promises lightning-fast scalable persistence while retaining high availability.
   We also have a completely new NIO based transport using Apache MINA.</para>
   <para> The goal of JBM 2.0 is simple and uncompromising- to bring unrivalled levels of performance and reliability to messaging, and to
	   become the fastest, best featured and most scalable messaging system in the open source space</para>
   <para>But enough marketing rhetoric!. We are not in the business of making empty statements with respect to performance so we ship this release with a set of basic performance measurements against competing messaging systems in the open source space, so you can decide for yourslef. All performance results are fully reproducible by you, using the tools shipped with this distribution.
   </para>
   <para>The procedure of installing and configuring JBoss Messaging is detailed in this guide, along with a set of
      runnable examples. This guide will be extended, before the general availability release of JBoss Messaging 2.0
