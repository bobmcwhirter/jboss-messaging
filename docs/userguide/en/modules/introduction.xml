   <para>JBoss Messaging provides an open source and standards-based messaging
   platform that brings enterprise-class messaging to the mass market.</para>

   <para>JBoss Messaging implements a high performance, robust messaging core
   that is designed to support the largest and most heavily utilized SOAs,
   enterprise service buses (ESBs) and other integration needs ranging from
   the simplest to the highest demand networks.</para>

   <!--<para>It will allow you to smoothly distribute your application load across
   your cluster, intelligently balancing and utilizing each nodes CPU cycles,
   with no single point of failure, providing a highly scalable and performant
   clustering implementation.</para>
-->
   <para>JBoss Messaging includes a JMS front-end to deliver messaging in a
   standards-based format as well as being designed to be able to support
   other messaging protocols in the future.</para>


   <para>Currently JBM 2.0 is only available standalone or embedded, The current JBoss AS 5 release contains JBM 1.4.2.</para>


  <!-- <section id="support">
      <title>JBoss Messaging support cover from Red Hat</title>

      <para>JBoss Messaging is destined to become part of both Application
      Server Platform and Service Integration Platform as default JMS
      provider.Production support will then be fully available for these
      plaforms and it will cover JBoss Messaging.</para>

      <para>There is a currently an early adopters program where production
      support is given for JBoss Messaging. Applications are considered on a
      case-by-case basis.</para>

      <para>Currently developer support is generally available for JBoss
      Messaging when installed in JBoss 4.2.x</para>

      <title>JBoss Messaging Features</title>

      <para>New features added since JBM 1.4</para>

      <itemizedlist>
         <listitem>
            <para>Journal based persistence.</para>
            <para>An append only file system where messages and transactions are stored at a high performance rate. We don't even need an external database for that.</para>
         </listitem>

         <listitem>
            <para>JBoss Messaging uses 
            <ulink url="http://mina.apache.org/">MINA</ulink> to provide high 
            performance and high scalability for its network layer with an 
            asynchronous API via Java NIO.</para>
         </listitem>

         <listitem>
            <para>Asynchronous IO (Linux only at the moment)</para>
            <para>Instead of syncing the disk and waiting slow IO operations to complete during transactions, we can submit the writes directly on the kernel and get a notification when it is complete. 
                  With this design we can support very high transaction rates even on very short transactions containing just few messages or acknowledgements. </para>
         </listitem>

         <listitem>
            <para>Standalone and embedded versions.</para>
            <para>You can embed JBoss Messaging at your own system without the requirement of any servers at all. Just instantiate few POJOS and you have a Messaging System running.</para>

         </listitem>  -->
      </itemizedlist>

     <!-- <para>Clustering features:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
         <listitem>
            <para>Fully clustered queues and topics. "Logical" queues and
            topics are distributed across the cluster. You can send to a queue
            or a topic from any node, and receive from any other.</para>
         </listitem>

         <listitem>
            <para>Fully clustered durable subscriptions. A particular durable
            subscription can be accessed from any node of the cluster -
            allowing you to spread processing load from that subscription
            across the cluster.</para>
         </listitem>

         <listitem>
            <para>Fully clustered temporary queues. Send a message with a
            replyTo of a temp queue and it can be sent back on any node of the
            cluster.</para>
         </listitem>

         <listitem>
            <para>Intelligent message redistribution. Messages are
            automatically moved between different nodes of the cluster if
            consumers are faster on one node than another. This can help
            prevent starvation or build up of messages on particular
            nodes.</para>
         </listitem>

         <listitem>
            <para>Message order protection. If you want to ensure that the
            order of messages produced by a producer is the same as is
            consumed by a consumer then you can set this to true. This works
            even in the presence of message redistribution.</para>
         </listitem>

         <listitem>
            <para>Fully transparent failover. When a server fails, your
            sessions continue without exceptions on a new node as if nothing
            happened. (Fully configurable - If you don't want this you can
            fall back to exceptions being thrown and manually recreation of
            connections on another node)</para>
         </listitem>

         <listitem>
            <para>High availability and seamless fail-over. If the node you
            are connected to fails, you will automatically fail over to
            another node and will not lose any persistent messages. You can
            carry on with your session seamlessly where you left off. Once and
            only once delivery of persistent messages is respected at all
            times.</para>
         </listitem>

         <listitem>
            <para>Message bridge. JBoss Messaging contains a message bridge
            component which enables you to bridge messages between any two
            JMS1.1 destinations on the same or physical separate locations.
            (E.g. separated by a WAN). This allows you to connect
            geographically separate clusters, forming huge globally
            distributed logical queues and topics.</para>
         </listitem>
