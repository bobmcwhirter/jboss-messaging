* Soak Test For Manual Reconnection of JMS Clients *
****************************************************

Run The Server
==============

To run server using the default configuration (server0, using localhost):
   $ ant runServer

To run multiple servers, you can specify the server configuration directory using server.dir 
system property (which defaults to server0). To run a 2nd server with a configuration stored in server1:

   $ ant -Dserver.dir=server1 

server1 dir contains a copy of server0 with different settings.

To run a server with the same configuration but on a different host, change:
* jbm.remoting.netty.host property in jbm-configuration.xml
* bindAddress and rmiBindAddress properties in jbm-jboss-beans.xml

Configure Server Dump
=====================

The server can "dump" info at regular interval. In jbm-configuration.xml, set

   <server-dump-interval>10000</server-dump-interval>

to have infos every 10s:

**** Server Dump ****
date:            Mon Aug 17 18:19:07 CEST 2009
free memory:      500,79 MiB
max memory:       1,95 GiB
total memory:     507,13 MiB
available memory: 99,68%
total paging memory:   0,00 B
# of thread:     19
# of conns:      0
********************

Run The Client
==============

Senders (resp. receivers) are run with "ant runSender" (resp. "ant runReceiver").
Parameters are specified in soak.properties. 
The duration of the tests is configured by duration-in-minutes (defaults to 2 minutes, set to 
-1 to run the test indefinitely).

To configure the soak properties to run the client, use the system property soak.props.
To specify the JNDI server to connect to, use the system property jndi.address
(defaults to localhost) and jndi.port (defaults to 1099)

To run a receiver connected to the local server with soak.properties
  $  ant runReceiver

To run a sender connected to another server using settings in paging-soak.properties:
  $ ant runSender -Djndi.address=172.16.8.10 -Djndi.port=2099 -Dsoak.props=paging-soak.properties

Every 1000th message, the clients will display their recent activity:

INFO: received 10000 messages in 5,71s (total: 55s)

At the end of the run, the sender and receiver will sum up their activity:

INFO: Received 223364 messages in 2,01 minutes

Kill The Server And Check Manual Reconnection
==============================================

You can kill the server (ctl+c or kill -9), the clients are configured to reconnect
indefinitely to the same single server (even in case of clean shutdown)
Once the server restarts, all the clients will resume their activities after reconnecting
to the server.
