* Soak Test For Manual Reconnection of JMS Clients *
****************************************************

Run The Server
==============

To run server using the default configuration (server0, using localhost):
   $ ant runServer

To run multiple servers, you can specify the server configuration directory using server.dir 
system property (which defaults to server0). To run a 2nd server with a configuration stored in server1:

   $ ant -Dserver.dir=server1 

server1 dir contains a copy of server0 with different settings.

To run a server with the same configuration but on a different host, change:
* jbm.remoting.netty.host property in jbm-configuration.xml
* bindAddress and rmiBindAddress properties in jbm-jboss-beans.xml

Configure Server Dump
=====================

A POJO is created by JBoss Microcontainer to "dump" server info at regular interval:

**** Server Dump ****
date:            Wed Aug 12 10:22:08 EDT 2009
heap memory:     used=1.44 GB, max=1.99 GB
non-heap memory: used=1.44 GB, max=1.99 GB
# of thread:     33
# of conns:      28
JMS queues:
	soakQueue: delivering 13 msgs to 7 consumers (13 msgs in memory, 22849506 added)
********************

The POJO is configured in the server dir's jbm-jboss-beans.xml:

<bean name="Dump" class="org.jboss.jms.soak.example.reconnect.ServerDump">
   <constructor>
      <!-- dump interval in minutes -->
      <parameter>1</parameter>
   </constructor>
</bean>

Run The Client
==============

Senders (resp. receivers) are run with "ant runSender" (resp. "ant runReceiver").
Parameters are specified in soak.properties. 
The duration of the tests is configured by duration-in-minutes (defaults to 2 minutes, set to 
-1 to run the test indefinitely).

To specify the JNDI server to connect to, use the system property jndi.address
(defaults to localhost) and jndi.port (defaults to 1099)

To run a receiver connected to the local server:
  $  ant runReceiver

To run a sender connected to another server: 
  $ ant runSender -Djndi.address=172.16.8.10 -Djndi.port=2099

Every 1000th message, the clients will display their recent activity:

INFO: received 10000 messages in 5,71s (total: 55s)

At the end of the run, the sender and receiver will sum up their activity:

INFO: Received 223364 messages in 2,01 minutes

Kill The Server And Check Manual Reconnection
==============================================

You can kill the server (ctl+c or kill -9), the clients are configured to reconnect
indefinitely to the same single server (even in case of clean shutdown)
Once the server restarts, all the clients will resume their activities after reconnecting
to the server.
