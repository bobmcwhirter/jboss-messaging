This is a simple tutorial on compiling libJBMLibAIO.so

DEPENDENCIES

Make sure you install these packages:

- G++ (yum install gcc-c++ or aptitude install g++)
- Gcc (yum insall gcc or aptitude install gcc)
- autotools-dev (including libtool, automake, autoconf) (yum install autoconf libtool or aptitude install autotools-dev autoconf libtool)
- Make (yum install make or aptitude install make)
- libaio (0.3.106) (yum install libaio or aptitude install libaio)
- libaio-dev (yum install libaio-devel or aptitude install libaio-dev)
- JDK (full JDK)


STEPS TO BUILD

1. Make sure you have JAVA_HOME defined, and pointing to the root of your JDK:

Example:
 
 $> export JAVA_HOME=/usr/share/jdk1.5.0_13
 
 
2. Call bootstrap. Bootstrap will call all the initial scripts you need
 $>  ./bootstrap
 
if you are missing any dependencies, autoconf would tell you what you're missing.
 

COMPILED FILE

The produced file will be under ./native/src/.libs/libJBMLibAIO.so


PERF-DISK

There is a script on this directory called perf-disk. This script will tell you how many bytes per second your disk is capable of.

If you interrupt this script, you will see a file (/tmp/foo.dat) created on your disk, which is used to measure the performance.



README IS A REQUIRED FILE

This file exists here as required by autoconf, or else we would have a compilation error.
