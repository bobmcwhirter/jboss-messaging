/**
 * 
 * A SafeUTF

 * 
 * There is a "bug" in JDK1.4 / 1.5 DataOutputStream.writeUTF()
 * which means it does not work with Strings >= 64K serialized size.
 * See http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=4806007
 * 
 * We work around this by chunking larger strings into smaller pieces.
 * 
 * Note we only support TextMessage and ObjectMessage bodies with serialized length >= 64K
 * We DO NOT support Strings written to BytesMessages or StreamMessages or written as keys or values
 * in MapMessages, or as String properties or other String fields having serialized length >= 64K
 * This is for performance reasons since there is an overhead in coping with large
 * Strings
