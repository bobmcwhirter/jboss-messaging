/**
 * A delegating {@link ExecutorService} with its own termination management.
 * <p>
 * {@link VirtualExecutorService} is used when you want to inject an
 * {@link ExecutorService} but you do not want to allow the explicit termination
 * of threads on shutdown request.  It is particularly useful when the
 * {@link ExecutorService} to inject is shared by different components and
 * the life cycle of the components depend on the termination of the injected
 * {@link ExecutorService}.
 *
 * <pre>
 * ExecutorService globalExecutor = ...;
 * ExecutorService virtualExecutor = new VirtualExecutorService(globalExecutor);
 *
 * ChannelFactory factory =
 *         new NioServerSocketChannelFactory(virtualExecutor, virtualExecutor);
 * ...
 *
 * // ChannelFactory.releaseExternalResources() shuts down the executor and
 * // interrupts the I/O threads to terminate all I/O tasks and to release all
 * // resources acquired by ChannelFactory.
 * factory.releaseExternalResources();
 *
 * // Note that globalExecutor is not shut down because VirtualExecutorService
 * // implements its own termination management. All threads which were acquired
 * // by ChannelFactory via VirtualExecutorService are returned to the pool.
 * assert !globalExecutor.isShutdown();
 * </pre>
 *
 * <h3>The differences from an ordinary {@link ExecutorService}</h3>
 *
 * A shutdown request ({@link #shutdown()} or {@link #shutdownNow()}) does not
 * shut down its parent {@link Executor} but simply sets its internal flag to
 * reject further execution request.
 * <p>
 * {@link #shutdownNow()} interrupts only the thread which is executing the
 * task executed via {@link VirtualExecutorService}.
 * <p>
 * {@link #awaitTermination(long, TimeUnit)} does not wait for real thread
 * termination but wait until {@link VirtualExecutorService} is shut down and
 * its active tasks are finished and the threads are returned to the parent
 * {@link Executor}.
