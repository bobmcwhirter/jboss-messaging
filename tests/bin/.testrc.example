# Each test can be run in clustered or non-clustered mode. However, setting CLUSTERED to "true"
# doesn't guarantee that the test will be actually run in clustered mode, the test database must
# be also permitting sharing over a LAN. "mysql" allows this, "hsqldb" doesn't. The test will
# quickly fail in such a situation.
# It is also possible to configure a test to run in clustered mode by using the "-clustered"
# switch.
