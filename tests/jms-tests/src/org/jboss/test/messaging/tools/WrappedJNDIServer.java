/**
 * A WrappedJNDIServer
 * 
 * We wrap the JBoss AS JNDI server, since we want to introduce a pause of 500 milliseconds on stop()
 * 
 * This is because there is a bug in the JBoss AS class whereby the socket can remaining open some time after
 * stop() is called.
 * 
 * So if you call stop() then start() quickly after, you can hit an  exception:
 * 
 * java.rmi.server.ExportException: Port already in use: 1098; nested exception is: 
 * java.net.BindException: Address already in use
